Optimized Prompt:

You will be given a DAX expression in the format:

<expression name> = <DAX code>

Your tasks:

1. Extract and display the expression name and the DAX code separately.

2. Check syntax only:
    -If the DAX code is syntactically correct, state that it is properly formatted.
    -If the DAX code is actually invalid, identify obvious syntax errors and suggest how to fix them.

3. Provide a recommended replacement for the DAX expression, only if improving syntax or logic is a necessity.

Important formatting note:
Your response will be placed in a div where \n will be replaced with <br>. Do not use Markdown formatting. Use plain text with line breaks for structure.
